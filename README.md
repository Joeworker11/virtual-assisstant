# virtual-assisstant
An earlier project of mine, where I gave instructions to an AI and it executes them accordingly. 


These assistant can execute instructions such like:
- loading a website
- file handling (opening, closing folders and files (music, picture loading with the method of loading the relative path)- additional features will be added later on such like new file creation, saves, editing text etc..)
- creating a simmple example chart for a presentation
- os commands such like restart, shutdown, exit etc. .
- saying jokes
- opening google/wikipedia and searching for something
- greeting according to the time 
- telling the exact date/time
- making a to do list + reminder function is also available
- (incomplete) Sarah is almost able to create 5-6 types of charts with speech recognition. --> I have encountered a problem, while the elements of X axis are working, 
The Y axis elements data types are cannot be recognized/or considered to be unknown. 

All the commands are written in the code section. I will add the instructions and details.
